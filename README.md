# ServerWidget
A widget created for The Minecraft Blog to show server status with JavaScript

# About
## What the heck is this
This is a widget designed for [The Minecraft Blog](http://the-minecraft-blog.com) to show stats for their servers without PHP. The widget references Syfaro's [Minecraft API](http://api.syfaro.net/) for JSON calls.

## Who can use this
Anyone can adapt this code to their needs. I'm not promising that this is the most efficient implementation, but it _does_ work. Since this widget was created for a specific implementation, there are some things that should be changed for other implementations, such as the arrow that links to a specific page on the blog.

I'd also appreciate it if you included some credit for this widget to either http://the-minecraft-blog.com or to this GitHub account.

## How to use this
If you want to use this for your servers, first you'll want to install [jQuery](http://jquery.com), then copy the JavaScript and CSS into wherever you want it. The HTML supplied is merely a guideline for what you should put into your HTML for this widget to work.
